# Ð¡heck Your Code Against the Following Points

## Code Efficiency

1. Prevent creating a redundant list via passing comprehension without square brackets when needed.

Good example:

```python
def get_sum(numbers: list) -> int | float:
    return sum(number for number in numbers)
```

Bad example:

```python
def get_sum(numbers: list) -> int | float:
    return sum([number for number in numbers])
```

2. Do not repeat abstract methods from parent if you have an abstract class that inherits another abstract class.

Good example:

```python
class Base(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def say_hi(self):
        pass


class Derived(Base, ABC):
    pass


class SayHi(Derived):
    def say_hi(self):
        print("Hi!")
```

Bad example:

```python
class Base(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def say_hi(self):
        pass


class Derived(Base, ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def say_hi(self):
        pass


class SayHi(Derived):
    def say_hi(self):
        print("Hi!")
```

## Code Style

1. Use one style of quotes in your code. Double quotes are preferable.
2. Use annotation, it is a good practice:

Good example:

```python
def multiply_by_2(number: int) -> int:
    return number * 2
```

Bad example:

```python
def multiply_by_2(number):
    return number * 2
```

3. Use descriptive and correct variable names:

Good example:

```python
players = ["Bob", "John"]

for player in players:
    pass
```

Bad example:

```python
players = ["Bob", "John"]

for i in players:
    pass
```
